Hello! I'm Max, a Junior at Farmington High School who is always working to learn things and improve my skills. Currently, I'm working to get ready for my future college journey and career. I am interested in math and computer science, and am planning to major in computer science in college. To prepare for this, I am active in my Robotics team and enrolled in coding classes in school.
