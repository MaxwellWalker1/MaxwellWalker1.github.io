## Personality
I consider myself to be a logical and detail-oriented person. I rely on routines to keep me going through the day, and I like it when everything in my life is neat and organized. I would say my strengths are my work ethic and my dependability. I try my absolute hardest to stick to my word and give everything I do 100% of my effort, which I think is part of the reason I am sucessfull. I would say my biggest weakness is my tendency to overthink things a lot, which leads to problems when I get overwhelmed with a lot of things at once. 
## Goals & Aspirations
I strive to excel in everything that I do. Currently, I am working to perfect my strategy for the SAT, which I am taking in April. My current best practice score is a 1570/1600, which is considered a very high score. Additionally, I am working to improve my performace as a soccer player, as I am currently a member of the FHS soccer team as well as an indoor boarded soccer leauge. In the future, I hope to strengthen my relationships with my friends and develop my career to a strong point.
