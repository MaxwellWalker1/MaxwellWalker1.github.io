title: SMART Goal
---
## Overview
In order to build my front-end / development skills, I set a goal for myself to build my portfolio from scratch on a personally hosted domain, as opposed to on a website development platform like Google Sites or Wix. This would mean I would have to do significantly more work, as I would have to code all of the buttons, images, and styling myself, but I knew that this would give me valuable experience that would be useful in my future computer science career.
## The SMART Process
A SMART Goal consists of five parts:
>**Specific**: The goal has to be specific, not vauge or too broad. My goal of building just my portfolio was very specific and focused, so it passes this category. <br>
**Measurable**: The goal has to have a measurable end condition, or a point where you know you've completed this. For me, this would be when I submitted my portfolio on Canvas. <br>
**Achievable**: The goal has to be realistic enough to be actually attainable. Although I knew my goal would be hard, I felt confident that I could do it. <br>
**Relevant**: The goal has to be relevant to what you want to achieve. Personally, I felt that my goal would be a great way to build experience in computer science for my career. <br>
**Time-Bound**: The goal has to have a time constraint. For my goal, the time constraint was when the portfolio assigment locked (Jan. 8).


## Steps to Success
I had five significant milestones when working towards this goal:


<u>Step 1</u>: Gained practice in web development by making a simple game in HTML (a website coding language). This served to teach me basic website skills that I could use for my portfolio.

<u>Step 2</u>: Researched ways to acquire a domain to host a website for free, eventually settling on Github Pages, which is a platform hosted by Github that lets you host a custom-coded website for free. <br>

<u>Step 3</u>: Set up the link to my website and applied a style template to the home page. I used the Cayman theme to create a colored header at the top of the website with my name, as well as handle basic formatting for me.<br>

<u>Step 4</u>: Added all of the required pages to my site and put placeholders where the content would later be. I also clickable links to the bottom of all of my pages so you could navigate the website easily.<br>

<u>Step 5</u>: Filled the pages with the various parts parts of my portfolio, including images and text. This was the most time-consuming part of the process, as I had to manually embed all of the images and videos in the website.<br>

```
## Reflection and Final Thoughts
I think that working towards this goal was a very productive exercise in web development. I learned a lot, both about HTML programming and how to host a website. I had to figure out how to design, code, and implement the website all by myself, which I think is an impressive feat. I hope to embark on similar projects in the future, and I might even use this portfolio in my future career.
