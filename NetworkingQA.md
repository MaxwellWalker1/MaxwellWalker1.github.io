## Explanation
I interviewed Bobby Jones, a professional in the field of computer science. I hoped to better understand the real experience of working in computer science, and what  I should do to prepare for entering the field. I chose to interview Mr. Jones due to his convient relationship with Mr. G, as he was Mr. G's cousin. This made him a very prospective choice because I knew I could count on him to be reliable and show up, since he knew Mr. G personally. Additionally, his job as a computer scientist exactly matched what I wanted to do.

Going into the interview, I was mostly looking to get information about the job market and how to best prepare to enter it. In my experience, this is the least documented aspect of computer science. Mr Jones was very helpful in answering my questions. He told me that the job market is very competitive, but I can set myself up well to prepare for it by studying the right things. Specifically, he recommended that I study object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C++, as they are high in demand and used frequently in the professional world. I was very pleased to hear this, as I already have experience programming in Java, and I am now considering studying C++ as well.
