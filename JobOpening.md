## Dream Career
My dream career is as a Computer Scientist, which is a person who uses computer programming to solve real-world problems. "Computer Scientist" is actually a very broad term, and encompasses a variety of jobs, from people working in enterprise programming to people who use computer science to solve math problems. I hope to work in some role that mainly focuses on computer science, whether it be in the corporate world or some other environment.
## Computer Science Job Requirements
To get this job, I would need to be very experienced in programming. Most computer scientists first do unpaid internships to gain repuation and experience, as well as completing a variety of personal coding projects to build their personal portfolio. Once they have demonstrated a wide array of coding skills and experience, they can get an entry-level job in a corporation. In order for me to get a CS job, I would likely need to do something similar, first building up my portfolio through coding projects and clubs before applying for an internship.
## RouteOne Java Internship
RouteOne is a  company that specializes in the car finance dealership business. Although this may not seem like a traditinal "tech" company, they have several openings for Java programmers, which goes to show that almost every type of company has a use for computer scientists, making it a good field to get into. I focused in on their currently available Java summer internship, which would involve a candidate going to their corporate office and shadowing senior engineers to gain experience. RouteOne would be a good place to work for me because they rely heavily on computer engineers because they have large databases and applications that require advanced technical infrastructure. This makes them a good possible employer because CS skills would be in demand there. 
## Skills and Resume

In order to build skills necessary to qualify for this job, I am working to improve my coding skills by completing projects and enrolling in programming courses. I hope to develop my skills enough to secure a summer internship similar to the one at RouteOne. Getting an internship would help me gain additional experience in the workforce and prepare better for having a real computer science job.
